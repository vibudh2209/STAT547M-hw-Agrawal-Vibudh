# Welcome to the hw01 of Vibudh Agrawal

The link to markdown file is [here](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT547M-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw01/hw01.md)

The process

- It took me some time to figure out how to check whether predicted location and city location is the same
- I was not able to figure out the cases where revgeocode did not give the result
- It also took me some time to figure out how should I filter countries with big difference in coefficients
- Overall I have to think a lot for making map work with more complex functions having more than one argument
