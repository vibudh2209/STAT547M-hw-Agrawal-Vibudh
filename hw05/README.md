# The progress 

- As I was working with more of character data (Game of Thrones) it took me sometime to come up with good plots.
- I faced difficulty using just map and not for loop while calculating number of stark characters every season and book.
- It was really fun to work with APIs and to come up good ways to make sense and visualize different type of datas (making data more presenatable after extracting)
- Though I did not work with scrapping data from html, it was fun doing in class and maybe I will work with in future apart from APIs.

# Resources used

- I used [this](https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/r_and_apis/) tutorial for fromJSON and other help here and there
- I also used few ideas like gluing urls usin glue from [class note](http://stat545.com/111Scraping_Workthrough.html)
- Apart from this for tidying the data and working with nested data I used previous homeworks.
