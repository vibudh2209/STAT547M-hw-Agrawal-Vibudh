## Overall Structure

**Initially data was imported from gapminder library in the form of country.tsv**

```{r}
country_data <- read.delim("country.tsv")
knitr::kable(head(country_data))
```


**Few reference plots were plotted**

- Year vs lifeExp weighted by population for all the contenents

- GDP spread across different continent

- average pop for each continent before reordering

![](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT547M-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw02/Pop%20Avergae%20for%20different%20continent.png?raw=true)

- average pop for each continent after reordering

![](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT547M-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw02/Pop%20Avergae%20reordered%20for%20different%20continent.png?raw=true)

**Continents were reordered based on lifeExp and both plots before and after reordering were plotted and reordered file was saved for further use**

- Median lifeExp for each continent befor reordering

- Median lifeExp for each continent after reordering

![](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT547M-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw02/Median_lifeExp%20reordered%20for%20each%20continent.png?raw=true)

**Next loaded the reordered file and proved that order is intact by plotting the lifeExp vs year for different continent and comparing it with unordered plot**

**Fitted a linear model to lifeExp vs year for each country by first nesting the data and then mutating using map and finally unnesting the data**

```{r}
nest_data <- readRDS("regression.rds")
knitr::kable(head(nest_data))
```

**Found the 3 worst countries for Asia and Africa (the rest can be done in same way) by checking the maximum standard error in predicted coefficients for each continent**

- Plot of LifeExp vs years for 3 worst countries for both Asia and Africa

![](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT547M-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw02/country_plot.png?raw=true)

- It is clear from the plot that there is a really bad trend for lifeExp vs years for each of the countries which implies poverty, war, epidemic etc

**Saved the data for these countries for both Asia and Africa**
