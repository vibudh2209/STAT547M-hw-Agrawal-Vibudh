**Initially data was imported from gapminder library in the form of country.tsv**

``` r
country_data <- read.delim("country.tsv")
knitr::kable(head(country_data))
```

| country     | continent |  year|  lifeExp|       pop|  gdpPercap|
|:------------|:----------|-----:|--------:|---------:|----------:|
| Afghanistan | Asia      |  1952|   28.801|   8425333|   779.4453|
| Afghanistan | Asia      |  1957|   30.332|   9240934|   820.8530|
| Afghanistan | Asia      |  1962|   31.997|  10267083|   853.1007|
| Afghanistan | Asia      |  1967|   34.020|  11537966|   836.1971|
| Afghanistan | Asia      |  1972|   36.088|  13079460|   739.9811|
| Afghanistan | Asia      |  1977|   38.438|  14880372|   786.1134|

**Few reference plots were plotted**

-   Year vs lifeExp weighted by population for all the contenents

-   GDP spread across different continent

![](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT547M-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw02/GDP%20Spread%20for%20different%20continent.png?raw=true)

-   average pop for each continent before reordering

![](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT547M-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw02/Pop%20Avergae%20for%20different%20continent.png?raw=true)

-   average pop for each continent after reordering

![](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT547M-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw02/Pop%20Avergae%20reordered%20for%20different%20continent.png?raw=true)

**Continents were reordered based on lifeExp and both plots before and after reordering were plotted and reordered file was saved for further use**

-   Median lifeExp for each continent befor reordering

![](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT547M-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw02/Median_lifeExp%20for%20each%20continent%20unordered.png?raw=true)

-   Median lifeExp for each continent after reordering

![](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT547M-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw02/Median_lifeExp%20reordered%20for%20each%20continent.png?raw=true)

**Next loaded the reordered file and proved that order is intact by plotting the lifeExp vs year for different continent and comparing it with unordered plot**

**Fitted a linear model to lifeExp vs year for each country by first nesting the data and then mutating using map and finally unnesting the data**

``` r
nest_data <- readRDS("regression.rds")
knitr::kable(head(nest_data))
```

| continent | country     | term           |    estimate|  std.error|  statistic|  p.value|
|:----------|:------------|:---------------|-----------:|----------:|----------:|--------:|
| Asia      | Afghanistan | (Intercept)    |  29.3566375|  0.6989813|   41.99918|  0.0e+00|
| Asia      | Afghanistan | I(year - 1950) |   0.2753287|  0.0204509|   13.46289|  1.0e-07|
| Europe    | Albania     | (Intercept)    |  58.5597618|  1.1335758|   51.65933|  0.0e+00|
| Europe    | Albania     | I(year - 1950) |   0.3346832|  0.0331664|   10.09104|  1.5e-06|
| Africa    | Algeria     | (Intercept)    |  42.2364149|  0.7562690|   55.84840|  0.0e+00|
| Africa    | Algeria     | I(year - 1950) |   0.5692797|  0.0221271|   25.72775|  0.0e+00|

**Found the 3 worst countries for Asia and Africa (the rest can be done in same way) by checking the maximum standard error in predicted coefficients for each continent**

-   Plot of LifeExp vs years for 3 worst countries for both Asia and Africa

![](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT547M-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw02/country_plot.png?raw=true)

-   It is clear from the plot that there is a really bad trend for lifeExp vs years for each of the countries which implies poverty, war, epidemic etc

**Saved the data for these countries for both Asia and Africa**
